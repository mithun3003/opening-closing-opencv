# Implementation of Erosion and Dilation Using OpenCV

## Aim

To write a Python program using OpenCV to perform morphological operations such as Erosion and Dilation on an image.

The program performs the following operations:

- Image Erosion
- Image Dilation

## Software Used

- Anaconda – Python 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Algorithm

### Step 1:

Import the required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Step 2:

Create a blank image using NumPy.

### Step 3:

Insert text onto the image using OpenCV's text drawing function.

### Step 4:

Display the original image.

### Step 5:

Create a structuring element (kernel) of suitable size.

### Step 6: Image Erosion

- Apply the erosion operation using the created kernel.
- Remove pixels from the boundaries of foreground objects.
- Display the eroded image.

### Step 7: Image Dilation

- Apply the dilation operation using the same kernel.
- Add pixels to the boundaries of foreground objects.
- Display the dilated image.

### Step 8:

Compare the original, eroded, and dilated images.

**Register No:** ______________________

## Output

### Original Image

- A text image containing characters is displayed.
- The image serves as the input for morphological processing.

### Erosion

- Original image is displayed.
- Eroded image is displayed.
- The thickness of the characters is reduced.
- Object boundaries shrink inward.

### Dilation

- Original image is displayed.
- Dilated image is displayed.
- The thickness of the characters increases.
- Object boundaries expand outward.

## Result

Thus, the morphological operations **Erosion** and **Dilation** are successfully implemented using OpenCV.
